var paragraph=`Regular exercise is one of the most important habits to maintain for a healthy lifestyle. It can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Exercise also helps manage weight, improves mood, and boosts energy levels.

Physical activity can come in many forms, including walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, weightlifting, yoga, and more. It's important to find an activity that you enjoy and can do regularly to make exercise a sustainable habit.

The recommended amount of exercise for adults is at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week. Strength training exercises should also be performed at least twice a week.

It's important to note that exercise should be done safely and within one's physical capabilities. It's always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional before starting a new exercise routine, especially if you have a chronic condition or have been inactive for a long period of time.

In addition to exercise, it's important to maintain a healthy diet and get enough restful sleep to support a healthy lifestyle. By making exercise a regular part of your routine and taking care of your overall health, you can enjoy the benefits of a healthier and happier life.`
